				ACCESSIBILITY Equal access requires for ease of criteria for obtaining health care services, both from the perspective of management support benefits and from the perspective of the response time in a way that makes it relevant.<br><br>

				CONTINUITY OF CARE  Hospital activity is organized so that there’s continuing medical care, which will imply mechanisms of interaction with other effectors, both first and second level of care as well as internal coordination procedures to enable the community to provide integrated continuing medical care.<br><br>

				EFFECTIVENESS The performance of health professionals should be guided by efficiency, i.e. interventions that ensure the maximum benefit for patients.<br><br>

				PERSONALIZED HEALTH CARE The hospital will maintain a care strategy that presides over the humane treatment, patients care and their family environment, considering the circumstances and characteristics of each situation; the crux of the health professional-patient relationship is respect. <br><br>

				EFFICIENCY Efficient management of resources releases the space budget to carry out new activities or improving the availability of human or material resources. The efficiency should be a tool to achieve the highest resolution level of health problems.<br><br>

				INNOVATION The hospital will develop innovative initiatives, both organizational aspects and health care, just like in the development of the research lines. Innovation as value allows the search of new horizons, permitting a better response to population needs within the scope of the hospital. <br><br>

				CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT Continuous quality improvement is a challenge for the hospital and its professional staff; it’s the result of commitment to society and its ambition to develop the hospital to its full potential.<br><br>

Complex biliary reconstruction. A growing number of surgical, percutaneous or endoscopic indications. Evaluation, monitoring, clinical and hepatological control of patients with acute and chronic diseases, whether or not they are candidates for transplantation. Liver transplants. This Transplant Programme includes not only patients from the province of Formosa, but from the NEA provinces and the Republic of Paraguay, thus functioning as a referral regional centre, without the need for referral from another health centre, taking advantage of existing infrastructure, equipment and  potential in the hospital.

    'tcardiac'            => "Heart transplant is currently considered the treatment of choice for refractory end-stage heart failure to medical or surgical treatment. Due to factors such as increased life expectancy of the population and more effective management of acute coronary syndromes, there are an increasingly large number of people suffering from heart failure. The prevalence of heart disease is estimated to be approximately 1% in developed countries; 10% of them are in an advanced stage and therefore they are potential heart transplant recipients. It is still not possible to offer this therapy for all patients who need it. It is therefore necessary to optimize the results for selection of patients for heart transplantation and selection and management of donors, perioperative management and disease control of graft rejection. Since the first heart transplant was performed in 1967, numerous advances and changes have occurred, improving survival and quality of life for those who have received a new heart. Heart failure is one of the major health problems. It is an important cause of medical consultation and is currently the leading cause of hospitalization. The problem is that each time patients are more likely to develop this complex syndrome and there is a significant increase in hospital occupancy of patients with heart failure.At present, it is assumed that heart failure is primarily a disease of elderly people and approximately 6-10% of patients over the age of 65 have heart failure and 80% of hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of heart failure are persons over 65 years of age.We initially recognize patients who are at risk of developing heart failure and take preventive policies is the first behavior that a program like that occurs, you should consider in order to prolong survival, improve quality of life and significantly reduce health care costs.Similarly, a program of comprehensive and systematic evaluation with close monitoring and individualized, is key to patient's clinical stability for longer periods without falling into the oversupply and / or subprestación that leads to wrong ports or to provide extreme therapeutic behavior while still not have exhausted treatment. Intrathoracic Transplant Program (cardiac and cardiopulmonary), no more than a complementary therapy for a selected group of patients under strict clinical and psychosocial criteria that have shown an inadequate response to optimal medical treatment.

<br><br>Conclusion:
<br>Transplant programs involving the hospital network in a comprehensive manner. In most cases the core source of the organ and the implants are not the same, which is a network of coordination, a complex communication and transport logistics and protocols of action designed for the times measured in minutes. The standardization process in the form of protocols, but somehow diminishes the clinical autonomy, channels achieving good results, facilitates their evaluation and, therefore, control of costs. A transplant program tests all the social services system which underpins and manages a global and inclusive. Of course all this would not be possible without the public awareness about the importance of organ donation.
